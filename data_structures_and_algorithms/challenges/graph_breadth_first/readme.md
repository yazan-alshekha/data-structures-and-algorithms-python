# Challenge Summary
Implement a breadth-first traversal on a graph. Sort the data in breadth_first

## Challenge Description
Extend your graph object with a breadth-first traversal method that accepts a starting node. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited. Display the collection.

Add a new method that called breadth_first

## Approach & Efficiency
- I used new approach that is how to extend your class with a new method

- Time complexity O(n^2)
