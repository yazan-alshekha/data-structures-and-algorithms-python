## Challenge Summary
Conduct a depth first preorder traversal on a graph

## Challenge Description
Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

Add a new method that called breadth_first

## Approach & Efficiency
- I used new approach that is how to extend your class with a new method

- Time complexity O(n)
