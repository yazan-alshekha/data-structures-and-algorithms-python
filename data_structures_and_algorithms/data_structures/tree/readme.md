## Trees
A tree data structure can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the "children"), with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root.

## Challenge
create a tree class that creates nodes correctly with left and right children create a binary search tree that can add new values in a correct order and check for a value if it exists in the tree or not

Approach & Efficiency
i used recursive approach binary tree effecnty: Space O(n) O(n) Search O(log n) O(log n) Insert O(log n) O(log n)

## API
**BinaryTree calss:**
- print_tree(): pass in a traversal type for it to print the tree in that traversal order (preorder,inorder,postorder)
- pre_order: prints the content of the binary tree in preordered fashion (Root->Left->Right)
- in_order:print the content of the binary tree in inordered fashion (Left->Root->Right)
post_order: prints the content of the binary tree in post order fashion (Left->Right->Root)

## BinarySearchTree class:
**add():** adds a new node to the binary tree in the correct postion

**contains():** checks if a value is in the tree and returns true of false based on that (true if the value is there and false if its not)
